## Overview

In the Exenia Campaign, each players controls a carrier starship with a large complement of classic Star Wars starfighters from the original trilogy and [Legends](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Legends) stories. The campaign plays out over a series of strategic turns, during which players will move their carriers, sortie their starfighters, resolve battles with games of Star Wars: X-Wing Second Edition, and attempt to collect enough fuel from the Black Sun refineries to safely return to known space.

Strategic turns are tracked on a hex map, which can be managed on [HexTML](https://hextml.playest.net/) using the [provided files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njablonski/ExeniaCampaign/master/assets/starting_map.html), or tracked with pen and paper or other software.

## Setup

The size of the map is 68 hexes, arranged in alternating rows of length 8 and 9. See the example map below, which shows the state of the map at the beginning of the campaign.
