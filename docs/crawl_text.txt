It is one month after the BATTLE OF ENDOR. The IMPERIAL NAVY is scattered and leaderless. REBEL forces have seized the opportunity to liberate worlds across the galaxy, and to chase down the IMPERIAL REMNANT.

On the OUTER RIM, two Rebel star cruisers have pursued an Imperial battle group beyond the borders of known space. Both sides are low on fuel, but the Imperial commanders refuse to surrender, and Rebel leaders believe this is their one chance to end the Empire forever.

In this frontier region, gangsters from the BLACK SUN SYNDICATE operate a secret fuel refinery on EXENIA STATION. When it is found by the beleaguered Rebel and Imperial forces, both fleets know that capturing the station is their only hope for returning alive to the known galaxy...
