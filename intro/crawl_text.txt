It is one month after the BATTLE OF ENDOR. The IMPERIAL NAVY is scattered and leaderless. REBEL forces have seized the opportunity to liberate worlds across the galaxy, and to chase down the IMPERIAL REMNANT.

On the OUTER RIM, two Rebel star cruisers have chased an Imperial battle group far beyond the borders of known space. Both sides are low on fuel and supplies, but the Imperial commanders prefer death to surrender, and Rebel leaders believe that this is their one chance to end the Empire forever.

In this frontier region, gangsters from the BLACK SUN SYNDICATE operate a secret mining base and fuel refinery on EXENIA STATION. When it is discovered by the beleagured Rebel and Imperial forces, both fleets believe that capturing the station is their only hope for returning alive to the known galaxy...
